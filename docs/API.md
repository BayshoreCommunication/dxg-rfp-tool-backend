# API Guide

> Purpose: API discovery and contract ownership. Last updated: 2026-08-12. Owner: backend engineering.

## Contract rules

- Versioned governed endpoints use `/api/v1`.
- Authentication is necessary but resource ownership/tenant authorization is checked separately.
- Mutation and durable-job creation endpoints use idempotency keys where duplicate side effects or provider charges are possible.
- Long-running operations return durable job/run references; clients recover through reads and SSE/status updates.
- Proposal writes validate canonical paths/values and use version checks against MongoDB authority.
- Public proposal payloads use an allowlisted projection.

## Version-aware vendor submissions

- `GET /api/vendor-responses/check` returns the stable submission ID, current version number, latest version ID, revision eligibility, and the latest compatibility response.
- `POST /api/vendor-responses` accepts `submissionIdempotencyKey` (or `Idempotency-Key`) and optional `submissionReason`. It creates version 1 or a new immutable revision; an idempotent replay returns the original version and receipt.
- `GET /api/vendor-responses/receipt/:versionId?proposalId=...&email=...` requires the same scoped `vendor:submit` public grant and a normalized vendor-email match. It returns version, checksum, timestamps, and safe file metadata without private object URLs.
- `POST /api/vendor-responses/manual` records a response the vendor delivered outside the portal. It requires authentication, `vendor-response:write`, and ownership of the proposal, and writes the same submission/version chain with `sourceSystem: "planner_upload"`. Neither the planner notification nor the vendor confirmation email is sent.

## Requirement registry

All routes are available by default without feature-flag environment variables. They still require an authenticated organization membership and proposal ownership. Reads require `proposal:read`; mutations require `proposal:write` and `Idempotency-Key`. Edit/approve requests also require the current set lock version through `If-Match` (or `expectedVersion`).

- `POST /api/v1/proposals/:proposalId/intelligence/requirement-sets` creates or idempotently returns a deterministic draft from current proposal fields and accepted rendered-RFP narrative.
- `GET /api/v1/proposals/:proposalId/intelligence/requirement-sets` lists versions with requirement counts and freshness.
- `GET /api/v1/proposals/:proposalId/intelligence/requirement-sets/:setId` returns the set, evaluation matrix, criteria, requirements, exact source locators, validation, and freshness reasons.
- `PATCH /api/v1/proposals/:proposalId/intelligence/requirement-sets/:setId/requirements/:requirementId` edits bounded review fields with optimistic locking.
- `POST .../:setId/approve` validates confirmed weights and completed human review, then freezes the version.
- `POST .../:setId/supersede` links an approved set to a new draft generated from the current proposal.

- Existing authenticated list/detail endpoints return current version metadata while retaining their response shape.

## Where to find endpoints

- Backend route overview and legacy API: `../README.md`.
- AI component endpoints and payload examples: the relevant file under `architecture/`.
- Exact executable behavior: route/controller schemas in `src/`; code wins if an old slice example differs.
- Operational health and dependencies: [runbooks/API_AND_DEPENDENCIES.md](runbooks/API_AND_DEPENDENCIES.md).

The repository does not currently publish a generated OpenAPI contract. Adding one from runtime schemas is a documentation gap; until then, avoid copying full endpoint catalogs into multiple documents.
